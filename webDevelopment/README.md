### Acknowledgments

This has been partly inspired by [Shovan Chatterjee](https://twitter.com/shovan_ch) and his wonderful [Full Stack Web Developer Path](https://github.com/shovanch/fullstack-web-developer-path) project. And of course by [Alexander Kallaway's](https://twitter.com/ka11away) very motivational [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and the great and supportive community around it.
